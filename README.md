# Ursacoin Whitepaper

View the whitepaper [here](ursacoin.github.io/whitepaper.pdf).

Cryptocurrency markets are still in their infancy. If history is any guide, we can expect cycles of extreme boom and busts (known as bull and bear markets). Ursacoin was developed as a hedge against the inevitability of this coming bear market. While we may not always be able to predict these cycles, itâ€™s nice to have a place in the stars while we wait for the moon.
